              Creating a crisp and well defined user flow and navigation system

              important to create a system that helps the user to understand

            <p>
              Wireframing is a crucial step whereby designers create a skeletal
              framework of the final product. It will define the hierarchy of
              items on a screen and communicate what the items on that page
              should be based on user needs.

            <p>
              Prototyping is integral to UX because it helps the designers to
              represent to the end user how the product will function as well as
              generate critical feedback from the user to alter the design.
